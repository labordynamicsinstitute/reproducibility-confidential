# Exercise 1-1

## Set up a project structure

<div class="blue3">

> Follow the lesson learned here and create a basic project structure

> 1. FORK the following repository: [labordynamicsinstitute/test-part-1-1](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/test-part-1-1)
> 2. Populate it with the directory structure
> 3. Push to your Github repository (your own fork)

> Did that work? 
</div>

## Populate the project structure

<div class="blue3">
> 4. Add a README describing the purpose of each directory
> 5. Push to your Github repository

> Did that work?
</div>

# Exercise 1-2

## Make a portable repository

<div class="blue3">
Once you are done, at most one line can be changed to make it run!

> 1. FORK the following repository: [labordynamicsinstitute/test-part-1-2](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/test-part-1-2)
> 2. Modify the code, either Stata or R.
> 3. Push to your Github repository (your own fork)

</div>

Do you think your code will work on somebody else's computer or in the cloud?
