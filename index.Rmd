# Reproducibility when data are confidential 

Journals require that you **share your code and data** in a replication package at the end of your research project. 

Following some best practices from day 1 can not only **help you prepare** this package later, but also make you **more productive** researchers. 

Following some best practices before releasing a package can **avoid costly revisions**.

# Goal

- [ ] Provide guidance on structure of replication packages when data are confidential
- [ ] Provide guidance on documentation
- [ ] Keep it simple

```{r, child=c(here::here('01-goal.md'))}
```

```{r, child=c(here::here('02-readme.md'))}
```

```{r, child=c(here::here('12-environments-in-stata.md'))} 
```

```{r, child=c(here::here('07-wrapping-up.md'))} 
```

# Appendix

# Note

> The appendix was modified after presentation to include additional material that was not covered in the presentation.
