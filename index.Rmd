## Reproducibility when data are confidential {.smaller}

Journals require that you **share your code and data** in a replication package at the end of your research project. 

Following some best practices from day 1 can not only **help you prepare** this package later, but also make you **more productive** researchers. 

Following some best practices before releasing a package can **avoid costly revisions**.
