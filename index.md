# Introduction

This document provides an overview of ensuring the reproducibility of your research when data are confidential. It is not meant to be exhaustive, and it is not meant to be prescriptive. There are many ways to construct a replication package.

Journals require that you **share your code and data** in a replication package at the end of your research project. Following some best practices from day 1 can not only **help you prepare** this package later, but also make you **more productive** researchers. Following some best practices before releasing a package can **avoid costly revisions**. 

## TL;DR

Techy lingo for "too long, didn't read". A summary of the most important takeaways will be at the top of each section.
